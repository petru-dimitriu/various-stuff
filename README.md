# Various stuff
Various interesting things I've written, mostly as part of faculty homework.

* **text-draw-funcs**: Elementary functions for drawing in (console) under Windows; uses Bresenham's line algorithm
* **counting-sort-asm**: Counting sort algorithm implemented in x86 assembly
* **karatsuba**: Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm implemented for any numeration base
* **digital-system-for-recursive-computation**: Verilog implementation of a digital system (data path + control path) capable of computing elements of the recursive sequence x<sub>n</sub> = 14*x<sub>n-1</sub>+n, with x<sub>0</sub>=0. Consists of several simple basic modules for sumation, comparison, etc, each with a minimal testbench module.
