# Various stuff
Various small, silly and potentially interesting things I've written, mostly as part of faculty homework, or otherwise unworthy of having a separate repository.

### x86 assembly
* **asm-counting-sort**: Counting sort algorithm
* **asm-bubble-sort**: Bubble sort algorithm
* **asm-factorial**: Factorial and gaussian sum

### Hardware description
* **digital-system-for-recursive-computation**: Verilog implementation of a digital syste*
* **single-cycled-mips-processor**: Verilog implementation of a MIPS processor supporting add, sub, sw, lw, beq instructions, with 1 cycle/instruction. Also contains a working code and data memory and a testbench for testing.m (data path + control path) capable of computing elements of the recursive sequence x<sub>n</sub> = 14*x<sub>n-1</sub>+n, with x<sub>0</sub>=0. Consists of several simple basic modules for sumation, comparison, etc, each with a minimal testbench module.

### Algorithms
* **karatsuba**: Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm implemented for any numeration base
* **optimal-weighted-bin-tree**: C++ algorithm to construct a binary tree so that its weighted external path length is minimal
* **huffman-encoding**: C++ program which reads a word and constructs a Huffman encoding, then encodes the word and prints it. Uses a heap of binary trees.

### Miscellaneous
* **text-draw-funcs**: Elementary functions for drawing in (console) under Windows; uses Bresenham's line algorithm
* **sudoku**: Yet another take at implementing a sudoku solver in C++. Features comments with explanations in Romanian.
* **hangman-awt**: Silly hangman game in Java / AWT
